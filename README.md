Capstone project for Coursera

<h1> Overview </h1>
<br>
<p> This is a more advanced webpage design that is the capstone project for the coure I'm taking on Coursera. This webpage includes a functional nav bar, footer, different sections, image and text animations. This project probably took me a little over a week to create from the ground up. I went off of a wireframe design that I created in Figma. The goal with this webpage was to see if I could create a direct copy of a webpage concept that I created in Figma. I'll inclide pictures of the wire frame and prototype I created as well so you can have refrence. </p>

 <p>Here we can see the wireframe design I created in Figma as well as the final prototype of our webpage. The goal again is to create a similar copy to the design given in Figma</p>
  

<h2> About </h2>
<p> This is a larger project that is a landing page for a Resturant called the Little Lemon. Complete with a functional nav bar, article flex boxes and a footer with a logo and copy right text. It also includes animations and affects for multiple text and images. I will include images for the webpage down below as well, so you can compare the Figma wirefram to the finished version. </p>
